                DrinkRack provides a hassle-free beverage rack service for employees in companies and offices. Once at least five employees express interest, a DrinkRack is delivered to the company premises. The service is free of charge for the company and employees. The company only needs to provide a suitable location for the rack. The service is currently available in Berlin, Germany. Employees can grab a drink whenever they want and only pay for what they consume.<br><br>

                Our beverage racks come in different sizes to accommodate various office needs. Designed with a modern aesthetic, they are built with sturdy wood and stainless steel and offer adjustable capacities ranging from 2 to 6 crate slots. Depending on the rack size, it can hold up to 144 drinks. We offer 20+ types of beverages, regularly updating our selection. We regularly check and restock the drink rack during opening hours. However, if the rack runs low unexpectedly, the company can contact us for a quick refill. <br><br>

                We handle the setup, delivery, and regular restocking of the beverage rack free of charge. The company where the drink rack is placed is responsible for providing a suitable location for the rack and ensuring it is accessible to employees. <br><br>

                Payments are made via a PayPal QR code or direct bank transfer. Employees can select their drinks and complete the payment accordingly. Employees are expected to complete payment immediately after selecting a beverage. The prices for each beverage are clearly displayed on the rack. If any beverages are missing or if payments were not made, we take full responsibility and cover the difference. Repeated non-payment may result in the removal of the drink rack from the premises. <br><br>

                There is no contractual relationship between DrinkRack and the company where the drink rack is placed. This service does not interfere with any existing agreements that the company may have with other suppliers or vendors. The DrinkRack service functions similarly to a standard delivery service. <br><br>
               
                The service can be canceled at any time without giving a reason. We reserve the right to terminate the service at any time without notice. In such cases, we will inform the company immediately and arrange for the removal of the DrinkRack. <br><br>
                
                We cover the costs of the rack and crates in the event of damage due to normal use. However, we assume no liability for personal injuries or other incidents arising from the use of the beverage rack, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.
